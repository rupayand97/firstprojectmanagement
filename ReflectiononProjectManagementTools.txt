Reflection on Project Management Tools:

GitHub's project management features—Milestones, Issues, and Project Boards—help teams work together and stay organized.

Milestones let teams set goals and deadlines by grouping related tasks, making it easy to track progress.

Issues are used to report bugs, suggest new features, or discuss ideas, keeping everything in one place.
Teams can assign issues to specific people, add labels to organize them, and link them to code changes for easy tracking.

Project Boards provide a visual way to manage tasks, using columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
This helps teams see the status of tasks and share responsibilities clearly.

These tools make communication smoother, reduce confusion, and keep projects on track. Since GitHub combines these tools
with version control, teams can manage tasks and development in one place, making collaboration simple and effective.
